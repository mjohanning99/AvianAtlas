Zoos are a great place to go to see species of birds not common in one's home country. They can, however, be problematic if the birds (and other animals, too) aren't kept well. Aviaries that are large and that resemble the birds' natural habitat are preferred. Zoos are also great for taking [[General/Photography|photos]] of birds, because the birds found in zoos are typically not shy as they are used to the presence of humans. This in turn, however, means that studying birds' natural behaviour is not possible in zoos.

One zoo I found particularly memorable not only due to the variety of species but also because of the large aviaries is the [[Berlin Zoological Garden]].
