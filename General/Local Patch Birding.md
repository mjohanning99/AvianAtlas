Local Patch Birding is a term used to describe regularly [[Birding|birding]] at an area that is very close to one's home. There is no actual definition for it yet, but if you have to drive to get there, I would no longer call it Local Patch Birding.

Not only is this the most ecologically-friendly way of birding (as you can walk or cycle to your local patch), it is also, in my opinion, one of the most exciting for various reasons. 

1. You learn more about your local area, both its fauna and flora. 
2. Regularly going birdwatching will make you more acutely aware of the behaviour of your local birds. Going birdwatching in a distant area and seeing a bird only once will not allow you to become "acquainted" with it.
