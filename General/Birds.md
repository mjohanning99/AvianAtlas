Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. 

A large amount of birds are [[General/Migration|migratory]]. The more exotic and colourful birds are often kept as [[zoo|zoo animals]] or pets.
