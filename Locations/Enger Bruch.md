Nature reserve popular with birders in the town of Enger, Germany. Easily reachable by public transport from Herford or Bielefeld (S15 from Bielefeld Hbf to Enger in 20 minutes then 15 minutes of walking). One observation platform. Platform might get a bit crowded when the weather is good. Generally quiet area and great for birdwatching. Red-Necked Grebes were observed there in 2023. Especially great during [[General/Migration|migration season]]. Overgrown during summer, so sightings might be difficult.
