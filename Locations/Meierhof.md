An old farmyard. Currently occupied by the Naturfreundehaus, Bootshalle and Boulderhalle. Barn Swallow territory. Confirmed breeding in 2022 and 2023. Nests are inside and actively encouraged. Starlings appear to have nested on the nesting boxes on the outside, but not confirmed. Nesting boxes have been hung up for dippers, but no takers yet. Apparent decline in Barn Swallow numbers according to a member of the Naturfreundehaus.
