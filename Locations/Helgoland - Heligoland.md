Helgoland (its English name is technically Heligoland, but I'll stick with the German name here) is a small island in the North Sea. Helgoland has always been a great place for spotting birds. The island hosts the annual Vogeltage ("Bird Days") in during the autumn migration, usually in October. 

The German [[ornithologist]] [[Heinrich GÃ¤tke]] is well-known on the island. 

The Vogelwarte on Helgoland uses a special net system to catch migratory birds, ring them and release them back. During peak [[General/Migration|migration]] season, several hundred birds get caught in the nets and [[General/Ringing|ringed]] every day. 

The island belonged to the British Empire until 1890.
