My first visit to the Berlin Zoological garden was on July 4th 2023. It was a rather short visit but it left a lasting impression. Their "Welt der Vögel" exhibit ("World of the Birds") was full of interesting [[General/Birds|birds]]. All of them were kept in at least adequately-sized [[General/Aviaries|aviaries]] with lots of plants and trees to hide in for the smaller birds. Most of these had both an indoor and and outdoor portion so that the birds could decide where to sit. 

There is, however, also a rather large walk-through aviary that was modelled after the natural habitat of the birds that were freely flying around in it. This was great because it really felt like going to the forest in a foreign country to find birds there. We didn't see all of the supposed inhabitants, probably because they were hiding somewhere in the trees. 

The amount of birds kept at the Berlin Zoo is also very impressive. According to Wikipedia, an astonishing 319 bird species were kept there as of 2013. I believe this number to have shrunk since then, as they reduced the number of species kept in 2016 when they opened the walk-through aviary. They also reduced the total number of regular aviaries so that there are now fewer aviaries that are bigger. 

There are two walk-through aviaries currently at the Berlin Zoo (Freiflughallen). Africa and Asia. The former is 450 m² and the other 405 m².
