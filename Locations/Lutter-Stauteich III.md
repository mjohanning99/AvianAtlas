## General Information
The place I visit most frequently as its directly next to my apartment. Part of the bigger [[Locations/Luttergrünzug|Luttergrünzug]]. Very crowded on weekends, especially in the summer. Best to go during the week when people are at work or early in the morning. Evenings tend to be crowded as well. A large artificial lake surrounded on both sides by footpaths and lots of shrubbery and trees. Two observation decks and a few other spots that are free of shrubbery can be used to watch the water birds. 53 species (2023-07-11) have been observed there by me. Seems to be a less popular migration spot as well, I have observed Pochards and Mergansers here during autumn migration.
