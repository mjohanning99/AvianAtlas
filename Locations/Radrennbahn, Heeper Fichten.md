The Radrennbahn / Heeper Fichten area is located close to the [[Locations/Luttergrünzug|Luttergrünzug]] in Bielefeld but it is not directly part of it. The most significant area is a football field that is popular with starlings as well as a small pond that is popular with coots, swans and ducks. 

Yellow-Billed Ducks appeared here in the summer of 2023, likely escapees. Both are ringed.
