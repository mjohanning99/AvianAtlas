Got this book at the Stadtbibliothek Bielefeld and really liked it. Lots of interesting topics. Mostly related to Germany, though the author does visit the UK briefly. She mentioned the so-called Vogeltage on [[Locations/Helgoland - Heligoland|Helgoland]], something I hadn't heard of before. Really made me want to go there. An interesting swift (Mauersegler) hospital in Frankfurt was also mentioned.
