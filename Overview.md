Welcome to the Avian Atlas! This Digital Garden (almost a wiki) is being tended to by [Marvin Johanning](https://marvinjohanning.de). I am a hobbyist birder from Bielefeld, Germany and my actual occupation is system administrator at a small ISP in Halle (Westf.), Germany. 

It contains information about varies [[General/Birds|bird]] species, each accompanied by at least one [[General/Photography|photo]], that I've seen at various locations such as [[General/Zoos|zoos]] or in the birds' natural habitat such as my [[General/Local Patch Birding|local patch]] in Bielefeld, the [[Luttergrünzug]]. Occasionally, I write [[Field Notes/Field Notes|field notes]] when I go on [[General/Birding Trips|birding trips]] or just when I see an interesting bird. I also write about books I've read or list interesting websites about birding and bird information.

The main language used on this site is English, but some parts — especially the field notes — might be written in German. 

The cover image is a [[Species/Charadriiformes/Little Ringed Plover - Charadrius dubius|Little Ringed Plover]] seen at the [[Rieselfelder Windel]] in Bielefeld.
